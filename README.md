#Aloha Apparel Co.
A responsive e-commerce site built with the focus on using Flexbox for displaying elements, applying Javascript / jQuery for simple interactive functionality.

###Tools and Languages Used
* HTML5 / CSS3
* Flexbox
* Media Queries
* Javascript / jQuery / jQuery Plugins

###Learning Outcomes
Having used HTML5 and CSS3 before, this project was a chance for me to explore more on what I could do with the said languages. It was helpful to find out the little hacks and tricks one can do with background images, how to incorporate font icons, among others. It also pushed me to unlearn some things and work according to industry-standard practices instead.

With this project, I got to learn and practice responsive development and apply a mobile-first approach. It was also my first time to use the Flexbox technique and to hand-code Javascript and jQuery. As with usual firsts, they were a challenge but I learned a lot that can help me with my future coding.

I enjoyed doing this project as much as I learned from it. Other than the tools and languages mentioned, working on the site was also a good reminder to pay attention to design details, keep directories clean, and code in a way that would make it easy for other developers to read.
