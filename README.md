##Learning Outcomes
Having used HTML5 and CSS3 before, this project was a chance for me to explore more on what I could do with the said languages. It was helpful to find out the little hacks and tricks one can do with background images, how to incorporate font icons, among others. It also pushed me to unlearn some things and work according to industry-standard practices instead.

This project was a great opportunity to learn and practice responsive development and applying a mobile-first approach. As well, it was a perfect practice slate for Flexbox, Javascript and jQuery, which are languages I've never really worked with before. They were a challenge, and it is with the shop section which uses Flexbox that I spent a bulk of my time doing the most, but thankfully not in vain.

I enjoyed doing this project as much as I learned from it. Other than the tools and languages mentioned, working on the site was also a good reminder and practice to pay attention to design details, keep directories clean and code in a way that would make it easy for other developers to read.
